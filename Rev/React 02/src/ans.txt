Some lke recap points
Now you know almost everything about JSX:

    *JSX attributes inside quotes are passed as strings.*
    *Curly braces let you bring JavaScript logic and variables into your markup.
    *They work inside the JSX tag content or immediately after = in attributes.*
    *{{ and }} is not special syntax: itâ€™s a JavaScript object tucked inside JSX curly braces.*

Objects are not valid as a React child
-- you'll have to destructure the Objects
