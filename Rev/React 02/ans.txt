// Some important points about props

React components use props to communicate with each other. Every parent
component can pass some information to its child components by giving them props.


Don’t miss the pair of { and } curlies inside of ( and ) when declaring props:

function Avatar({ person, size }) {
  // ...
}
This syntax is called “destructuring” and is equivalent to reading properties from a function parameter:

function Avatar(props) {
  let person = props.person;
  let size = props.size;
  // ...
}
